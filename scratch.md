CKING NOTES
Molecular weight = mass of a substance (in grams) / number of moles
Number of moles = Mass of substance / Mass of one mole.
Calculate he number of moles you have by taking the Mass / molar mass.
Atom_n = # of protons in nucleus
Mass_n = # of protons + neutrons in nucleus
Periodic Table (atomic_n, acro, average atom mass); atomic_n / acro / average atom
Problem Format ({mass_n}^_{atomic_n}{acro})
Proton = atom_n
Neutron = mass_n â€“ atomic_ n
Electron = atom_n - charge

```python
def calc_molecular_weight(mass_substance_gram):
  return molecular_weight /
